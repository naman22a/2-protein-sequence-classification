# 🧬 Protein Sequences Classification

This project explores the application of **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, and **Transfer Learning (TL)** techniques to classify **structural protein sequences**. By treating protein sequences like natural language, we leverage NLP-inspired approaches to identify and classify structural types based on sequence patterns.

## 📌 Project Overview

Proteins are composed of sequences of amino acids, and their structure plays a critical role in their function. This project applies **traditional ML algorithms**, **sequence-based neural networks**, and **state-of-the-art pretrained models** for classifying protein sequences into structural categories.
